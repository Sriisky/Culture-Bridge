Darmstadt is definitely a student city with lots of pubs and clubs across the city."

Nothing is too expensive, everything is within walking distance and clubs are always busy, you can more or less pick a club and it's guaranteed to be buzzing.\n\nThe German students studying in Regensburg are also incredible - really friendly and always eager to offer to do things with you or recommend places to go and things to see."
