# Culture Bridge – A website application to encourage students’ participation in study abroad programmes
## Final year project

My project idea is to develop a website application to help encourage more Irish students to take part in Erasmus+. This will be achieved through giving users’ information on different cities that take part in the Erasmus programme. There are huge benefits to studying abroad and I want to create an app that helps users to explore the advantages of Erasmus+ along with the experience you can gain from studying in a new culture.
